`Main concepts`
The process of optimizing a website can be divided into three main pillars:

1. Technical – Optimize your website for crawling and web performance
2. Creation – Create a content strategy to target specific keywords
3. Popularity – Boost your site's presence online so search engines know you are a trusted source. This is done through the use of `backlinks` – third-party sites that link back to your site.
